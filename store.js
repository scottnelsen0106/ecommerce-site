// I need to be able to display all of my images that have prices on them.

// I need to be able to have an Add To Cart button for each item that when clicked will add the item to a cart.

// When I view my cart, I need to have all the items that I clicked on viewed. those items need a proceed to checkout button and also be able to remove items from my cart.

// In my view cart page, I need to have a proceed to checkout button that will send an alert that my order shipped. I also need an option on this that can decline a checkout that will send me back to the store page.
